What is a bit?
A bit is the smallest unit of data in computing, representing a binary value of either 0 or 1.

What is a crumb?
A crumb is not a widely used term in computer science. However, in some contexts, it refers to 2 bits. It’s a less common way to describe small data units.

What is a nibble?
A nibble consists of 4 bits. It can represent 16 different values (from 0000 to 1111 in binary).

What is a byte?
A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits. It can represent 256 different values (from 0 to 255 in decimal).

How many bits in a byte?
There are 8 bits in a byte.

How many crumbs in a byte?
If we consider a crumb to be 2 bits, then there are 4 crumbs in a byte (since 8 bits / 2 bits per crumb = 4).

How many nibbles in a byte?
There are 2 nibbles in a byte (since a nibble consists of 4 bits, and 8 bits / 4 bits per nibble = 2).

How many crumbs in a nibble?
If a crumb is considered to be 2 bits, then there are 2 crumbs in a nibble (since a nibble is 4 bits).

What is the lower nibble?
The lower nibble refers to the rightmost 4 bits of a byte. For example, in the byte 10101100, the lower nibble is 1100.

What is the upper nibble?
The upper nibble refers to the leftmost 4 bits of a byte. In the same byte 10101100, the upper nibble is 1010.

What is LSB? And why do we call it LSB? What’s its value?
LSB stands for Least Significant Bit, which is the rightmost bit in a binary number. It is called "least significant" because it contributes the least to the overall value. Its value can be either 0 or 1.

What is MSB? And why do we call it MSB? What’s its value?
MSB stands for Most Significant Bit, which is the leftmost bit in a binary number. It is called "most significant" because it contributes the most to the overall value. Its value can also be either 0 or 1.
