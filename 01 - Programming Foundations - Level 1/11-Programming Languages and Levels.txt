A programming language is a formal set of instructions that can be used to produce a wide range of outputs, including software applications, algorithms, and systems. Programming languages allow developers to communicate with computers by writing code that the computer can interpret and execute. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

What is Code?
Code refers to the written instructions in a programming language that are used to create software programs. It consists of commands, syntax, and structure defined by the programming language. Code can perform tasks, manipulate data, and control the behavior of a computer system or application.

What is Source Code?
Source code is the human-readable version of a program written in a high-level programming language. It consists of statements and instructions that define the program's functionality. Source code is what programmers write and modify, and it must be translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter before it can be executed by a computer.

What is Object Code?
Object code is the machine-readable output generated by a compiler after processing the source code. It consists of binary instructions that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU. Object code may not be fully executable and often needs to be linked with other object files or libraries to create a complete executable program.

Why do we need Compilers or Interpreters?
Compilers and interpreters are tools that convert source code into machine code so that it can be executed by a computer.

A compiler translates the entire source code into object code before execution, resulting in faster execution times once compiled.
An interpreter, on the other hand, translates and executes the source code line by line at runtime, which can make debugging easier but may result in slower execution speeds.
We need these tools to bridge the gap between human-readable code and machine-executable code.

When is a language considered Fast?
A programming language is considered fast when it can execute tasks with minimal latency and high efficiency. This is often influenced by factors such as the language's design, the efficiency of its compiler or interpreter, and the optimization of the resulting machine code. Lower-level languages like C or C++ are typically faster because they are closer to machine code and allow for fine-tuned optimizations.

When is a language considered Slow?
A programming language is considered slow when it has high execution times, often due to factors like abstraction, runtime interpretation, or overhead from language features. High-level languages, such as Python or Ruby, may be slower compared to lower-level languages because they offer greater abstraction and ease of use, which can add overhead during execution.

What is a high-level language?
A high-level language is a programming language that provides strong abstraction from the details of the computer's hardware. These languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write, often resembling natural language or using mathematical notation. Examples include Python, Java, and C#. High-level languages typically require a compiler or interpreter to convert them into machine code.

What is a low-level language?
A low-level language is a programming language that provides little abstraction from the computer's hardware. Low-level languages are closer to machine code and allow for direct manipulation of memory and hardware resources. They are more complex and less readable than high-level languages. Examples include assembly language and machine code. Low-level languages are often used for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

When do we consider a language to be human-readable?
A programming language is considered human-readable when its syntax and structure are designed to be easily understood by people. This typically includes clear, logical organization of code, the use of descriptive variable names, and syntax that resembles natural language. High-level languages are usually human-readable, while low-level languages are not, as they consist of binary or assembly code that is difficult for humans to comprehend.
