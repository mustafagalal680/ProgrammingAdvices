
12 >= 12

Result: True
Explanation: 12 is equal to 12.
NOT (12 >= 12)

Result: False
Explanation: Since 12 >= 12 is True, NOT True is False.
1 AND 1

Result: True
Explanation: Both conditions are True, so the result is True.
(7 = 7) AND (7 > 5)

Result: True
Explanation: Both 7 = 7 and 7 > 5 are True, so the result is True.
12 > 7

Result: True
Explanation: 12 is greater than 7.
8 < 6

Result: False
Explanation: 8 is not less than 6.
8 = 8

Result: True
Explanation: 8 is equal to 8.
12 <= 12

Result: True
Explanation: 12 is equal to 12.
7 = 5

Result: False
Explanation: 7 is not equal to 5.
NOT (12 < 7)

Result: True
Explanation: 12 is not less than 7, so NOT False is True.
NOT (8 < 6)

Result: True
Explanation: 8 is not less than 6, so NOT False is True.
NOT (8 = 8)

Result: False
Explanation: 8 is equal to 8, so NOT True is False.
NOT (12 <= 12)

Result: False
Explanation: 12 is less than or equal to 12, so NOT True is False.
NOT (7 = 5)

Result: True
Explanation: 7 is not equal to 5, so NOT False is True.
True AND 0

Result: False
Explanation: 0 is treated as False, so True AND False is False.
0 OR 1

Result: True
Explanation: Since 1 is True, the result is True.
0 OR 0

Result: False
Explanation: Both conditions are False.
NOT 0

Result: True
Explanation: 0 is treated as False, so NOT False is True.
NOT (1 OR 0)

Result: False
Explanation: Since 1 OR 0 is True, NOT True is False.
(7 = 7) AND (7 < 5)

Result: False
Explanation: 7 = 7 is True, but 7 < 5 is False, so True AND False is False.
(7 = 7) OR (7 < 5)

Result: True
Explanation: 7 = 7 is True, so True OR False is True.
(7 < 7) OR (7 > 5)

Result: True
Explanation: 7 < 7 is False, but 7 > 5 is True, so False OR True is True.
NOT (7 = 7) AND (7 > 5)

Result: False
Explanation: 7 = 7 is True, so NOT True is False. Thus, False AND True is False.
(7 = 7) AND NOT (7 < 5)

Result: True
Explanation: 7 = 7 is True, and 7 < 5 is False, so NOT False is True. Therefore, True AND True is True.
